# is the number of "done" APPROVED words for the language when the last update from crowdin happened
Remember when updating from crowdin to only replace our mod lang files up to but not including the moves/abilities/species dex information.
Those don't get translated on crowdin because it's 500 million words, and we have official translations for some that we don't want to replace.
They're always the bottom bulk of our mod lang files.
